Hello, my name is Tristan McDermott. On this blog, I will document my personal projects and technical accomplishments, and maybe talk about my other interests too.

Some things to know about me: I am currently a junior at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I don't have any serious industry experience yet, but I have been employed at my university. In summer 2023, I worked as an instructor for the [SoarCS](https://www.uml.edu/Sciences/soarcs.aspx) program, which is meant to help incoming freshman adapt to university life and learn about computer science. This summer, I'll be working with them again as an instructor. Right now, I'm doing research with a professor on automatic proof generation for programming language theorems.
